## 1. Zero Draft: 


## 2. First Draft: 


## 3. Take a print out and go on a vacation: 

- Courier or Courier Prime Font, double spaced, should take a minute to read a page. 
- Use Red Pen and Blue Pen. 
- Use Red Pen circle for problems, strikethrough for removal and arrows for chaging the places.
- Give numbers to things which should be releated. 
- Blue for the edits which you are not sure of right now. 
- Read it out aloud and save it in a voice memo. Hearing it may make new things standup.


## 4.  First Edit : 
## 5. Second Edit : 

## 6. Third Edit : 
**Line Editing Going word by word : sentences and paragraphs need justification.** 

- FOM: Frame of Mind inconsistency between the narrator and the current character. character's emotions should not be reflected in narrator. 

- EI : Extra Information, is this really needed? is this detail adding anything to the story line? "blue hair" should have some significance apart from the visual imagiry? 

- MO : Mismatched Order, is the order of events really correct? Should this thing be introduced at this place? Or before and after some event. 

- W: Words, 
  - use different words
  - words should mean the exact thing they are used for, not some other variying intensity of it. 
  - Remove same words used frequently in near by area, until needed!
  - lazy writing: Using very / using contructs "make a living" rather than "earn a living"
  - Don't use words, until they _**add**_ something to the plot, especially for adjectives, adverbs and modifiers. 

  - ad: Use different adjectives/adverb. they break the flow of thought. Don't use them until you need them. 

- FS: Frame the sentence differently, the structure should not be convoluted. It should be natural flow of things. 

- LI : Logical Inconsistency: "returned" from where? "as a result" of what? these constructs should not be dangling.

- MQ: missattributed quote: a direct quote should not be missattributed. even if it keeps the sentiment same, if the character is thinking he called me incompetent. He should have exactly called incompetent. People do not use synonyms when thinking about other people comments. 

- HF : Is this universe Logcial? And other those logic is this a fallcay?

- Typo: Simply a mistake in typing. 

- Active Voice preffered over passive voice. Know the diffrerence first. 
-  Mixing metaphors : your readers are watching you like you're a hwak.
