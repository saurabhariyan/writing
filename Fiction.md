## Zero Draft: 


## First Draft: 


## First Edit :
- FOM: Frame of Mind inconsistency between the narrator and the current character. character's emotions should not be reflected in narrator. 

- EI : Extra Information, is this really needed? is this detail adding anything to the story line? "blue hair" should have some significance apart from the visual imagiry? 

- MO : Mismatched Order, is the order of events really correct? Should this thing be introduced at this place? Or before and after some event. 

- W: Words, use different words, words should mean the exact thing they are used for, not some other intensity of it. Using "very" is lazy! 

  - adj: Use different adjectives or maybe use no adjectives. they break the flow of thought. Don't use them until you need them. 

- FS: Frame the sentence differently, the structure should not be convoluted. It should be natural flow of things. 

- LI : Logical Inconsistency: "returned" from where? "as a result" of what? these constructs should not be dangling.

- MQ: missattributed quote: a direct quote should not be missattributed. even if it keeps the sentiment same, if the character is thinking he called me incompetent. He should have exactly called incompetent. People do not use synonyms when thinking about other people comments. 

- HF : Is this universe Logcial? And other those logic is this a fallcay?

- Typo: Simply a mistake in typing.
