# My Very Opinionated Processess of Long Form Writing

This is the process i follow for writing in long form, anything above 2000 words, could be a blog post, an article, an essay or a novel.

By reading other first drafts. Reading unpolished drafts of other was the biggest help in developing this methods. These were the things that stood out and were kind of annoying to me. This were the things I definately didn't want in a final draft.
